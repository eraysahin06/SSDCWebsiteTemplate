                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>
                    As a software developer student club at Seneca College, our vision is to provide a supportive and innovative environment for students to explore their passions in the field of software development. We aim to bring together students with a common interest in technology, programming, and software engineering to collaborate, learn and grow their skills. Our club serves as a hub for students to connect with each other, industry professionals and to develop real-world projects that can demonstrate their abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Our goal is to provide students with the tools, resources and opportunities necessary to help them excel in their careers as software developers. We plan to achieve this through weekly meetings, hackathons, workshops, guest speakers and mentorship programs. Our members will have access to cutting-edge technology and industry-standard software development tools to work on their projects. We also aim to collaborate with local companies and organizations to provide our members with internships, co-op placements, and job opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finally, we believe that the success of our club is dependent on the contributions of our members. We encourage students to participate in club activities, volunteer for leadership positions and contribute their skills and expertise to help drive the club forward. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced software developer, we welcome you to join our club and become a part of a dynamic community of students who are passionate about software development. Let's work together to shape the future of technology and software development at Seneca College!
